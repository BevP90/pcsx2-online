It's a fork of open-source PlayStation 2 emulator PCSX2 with netplay. Now you can play all the PS2 games that support local multiplayer, throught with your friends on the internet!

==How to use
System -> Boot Netplay. The connection dialog is pretty self-explanatory.

==What you should know
* Each side must use the same bios file
* Each side must use the same game image
* Make sure you have the same memory cards before playing, or memory cards will be disabled after consistency check - all the settings will reset to defaults, no unlockables, and you won't be able to save during the game. You can disregard that if memory cards are not really needed.

==Features:
* Game and bios image checks between sides
* Automatic input delay detection
* Memory cards are being disabled if they are not consistent on each side.

==Notes:
During netplay, settings are changed to defaults with all speedhacks disabled, so performance may drop a bit. 'Skip Mpeg' hack is enabled during netplay.

==Tested and working:
* Melty Blood Actress Again (Netplay was basically was made for this game alone)
* Guilty Gear XX Accent Core (US Release)

==Tested and not working (i.e. will be fixed soon):
* Tekken 5
