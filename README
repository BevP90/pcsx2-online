Fork of pcsx2 with netplay (p2p). It's still in the early stages of development, but may already work.

Features:
* Game and bios image checks between sides
* Automatic input delay detection
* Memory cards are being disabled if they are not consistent on each side.

Notes:
During netplay, settings are changed to defaults with all speedhacks disabled, so performance may drop a bit. 'Skip Mpeg' hack is enabled during netplay.
