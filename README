Fork of pcsx2 with netplay (p2p). It's still in the early stages of development, but may already work.
I only forked the emulator core, so repository doesn't contain any plugins.

Game and bios image checks between sides
Automatic input delay detection
Memory cards are being disabled if they are not consistent on each sides.
During netplay, settings are changed to defaults with all speedhacks disabled, so performance may drop a bit. 'Skip Mpeg' hack is enabled.
