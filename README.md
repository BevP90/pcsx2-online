How to start netplay
--------------------

System -> Boot Netplay. The connection dialog is pretty self-explanatory.

What you should know before playing
-----------------------------------

* To avoid desyncs do not change any settings except for the controller plugin configuration. It's not like it will definitely desync if you change anything, but the possibility escalates.

* During netplay, emulation settings are temporarily reset to defaults with all speedhacks disabled, so performance may drop a bit. And by 'emulation settings' I mean Config->Emulation Settings dialog, so plugin settings remain intact.

* 'Skip Mpeg' hack is enabled during netplay, because cutscenes are prone to desync.

* Peer-to-peer network connection, no centralized servers needed
