PCSX2 Online
============

PCSX2 Online is a fork of open-source PlayStation 2 emulator PCSX2 with netplay. Now you can play PS2 games with your friends on the internet!

How to start netplay
--------------------

System -> Boot Netplay. The connection dialog is pretty self-explanatory.

What you should know
--------------------

* Each side must use the same bios file

Features
--------

* Peer-to-peer network connection, no centralized servers needed
* Automatic input delay detection

Notes
-----

During netplay, settings are temporarily reset to defaults with all speedhacks disabled, so performance may drop a bit. 'Skip Mpeg' hack is enabled during netplay, so there won't be unexpected desyncs.
